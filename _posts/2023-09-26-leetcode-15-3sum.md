This question was a challenge. I tried approaching this with the Two Sum method, running a FOR loop for the first number and using the Two Sum approach for the sum of the remaining two numbers. This has a time complexity of O(n^2). 

Here is my initial solution : 
```python
def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:

    tripletList = []

    nums.sort()

    for i in range(len(nums)) :
        if nums[i] > 0 :
            break 

        pointer1 = i + 1
        pointer2 = len(nums) - 1

        targetPairSum = 0 - nums[i]

        while pointer1 < pointer2 :
            if nums[pointer1] + nums[pointer2] == targetPairSum :
                if [nums[i],nums[pointer1],nums[pointer2]] not in tripletList : 
                    tripletList.append([nums[i],nums[pointer1],nums[pointer2]])
                pointer1 += 1
                pointer2 -= 1
            elif nums[pointer1] + nums[pointer2] < targetPairSum :
                pointer1 += 1
            else :
                pointer2 -= 1

    return tripletList
```

I was able to pass all testcases, however, the runtime was significantly slow - 5043ms (beats 9.35%). Hence, I thought of a way to optimize my code for a faster runtime. 

Here is my optimized code : 
```python
def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:

    tripletList = []

    nums.sort()

    for i in range(len(nums)) :
        #duplicate first number
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1] : 
            continue 

        if nums[i] > 0 :
            break 

        pointer1 = i + 1
        pointer2 = len(nums) - 1

        targetPairSum = 0 - nums[i]

        while pointer1 < pointer2 :
            if nums[pointer1] + nums[pointer2] == targetPairSum :
                
                tripletList.append([nums[i],nums[pointer1],nums[pointer2]])
                pointer1 += 1 # only need to update one pointer
                while nums[pointer1] == nums[pointer1-1] and pointer1 < pointer2 : #duplicate check 
                    pointer1 += 1
            elif nums[pointer1] + nums[pointer2] < targetPairSum :
                pointer1 += 1
            else :
                pointer2 -= 1

    return tripletList
```
As shown above, I changed the way of checking for duplicate triplets and this significantly improved the runtime - 914ms (beats 81.00%). I realized this is because I initially had to check the entire list for duplicate triplets, but this modified code simply skips all consequent identical numbers. Only updating one pointer also gave a minor improvement in the runtime - realized that update in both pointers in not neccessary since we check pointer1 < pointer2 anyway.
