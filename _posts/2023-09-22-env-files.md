While studying FastAPI, I came across an unfamiliar file called an ".env file" and decided to read up on it. 

An .env file , as the name implies, is a text file that contains environment variables. The main purpose of such file is to protect sensitive infromation such as API keys, secret keys , passwords, tokens etc. Hence this file should be added in .gitignore to provide security. Besides security, it is also useful when deploying your application to different environments or when adding new environment variables. 

This is an example of what a .env file might look like : 
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/dbname
API_KEY=abc123
SECRET_KEY=xyz456
```

In FastAPI projects, we can use the python dotenv library to write and read data from the .env file. 
```
pip install python-dotenv
```
Then next create .env file and store it in the **root** directory. 

Finally create a config file in the root directory with the name *config.py*. In config.py, import load_dotenv() function :
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv() 
```
We can use os.getenv() function to retrieve the values of the variables
```python
import os
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
```
Make sure to use a separate .env file for each environment!
